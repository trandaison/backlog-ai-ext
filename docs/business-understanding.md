## 🔧 Technical Business Logic

### Advanced AI Integration Strategies

#### **Backlog MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration** 🆕
**Potential Implementation**:
```typescript
// MCP Server for Backlog Integration
interface BacklogMCPServer {
  // Ticket relationship analysis
  analyzeTicketRelationships(ticketId: string): Promise<RelatedTicketData>

  // Cross-ticket pattern recognition
  identifyPatterns(projectId: string, ticketIds: string[]): Promise<PatternInsights>

  // Team communication analysis
  analyzeTeamCommunication(projectId: string): Promise<CommunicationPatterns>

  // Smart suggestions based on project history
  suggestSolutions(ticketData: TicketContent): Promise<SolutionSuggestions>
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Deep integration with Backlog's data model
- Cross-ticket intelligence and pattern recognition
- Team-specific learning and adaptation
- Enhanced context understanding

#### **Enhanced User Context System**
```typescript
interface UserContext {
  role: 'Developer' | 'PM' | 'QA' | 'Designer' | 'DevOps'
  primaryLanguage: 'ja' | 'vi' | 'en'
  communicationStyle: 'formal' | 'technical' | 'managerial'
  teamHistory: CommunicationPattern[]
  projectExperience: ProjectContext[]
}
```

### AI Prompt Strategy

#### **Context Building for Single Ticket**:
```
1. Extract comprehensive ticket metadata:
   - Title, description, priority, status
   - Assignee, reporter, labels, milestones
   - Creation/update timestamps
   - Related ticket references

2. Analyze comment thread chronologically:
   - Identify language patterns
   - Track decision points and status changes
   - Extract technical details and code references
   - Map participant roles and communication styles

3. Build relationship context:
   - Parse ticket dependencies and blockers
   - Identify similar past tickets
   - Extract project-specific terminology
   - Understand team communication patterns
```

#### **Smart Reply Enhancement Logic**:
```
IF user provides draft content:
  - Analyze grammar and structure
  - Suggest improvements while preserving meaning
  - Adapt tone for Japanese business culture
  - Offer alternative phrasings

IF user requests bilingual content:
  - Generate primary language version
  - Create culturally appropriate translation
  - Maintain technical accuracy
  - Provide format options (English below, side-by-side)

IF context suggests formal response needed:
  - Apply Japanese business communication standards
  - Use appropriate honorifics and formal structures
  - Maintain professional distance and respect
```

#### **Translation Context Enhancement**:
```
Language Detection Priority:
1. User explicit prompt override
2. Automatic detection with confidence scoring
3. Context-based inference (project language patterns)
4. Fallback to user's primary language setting

Technical Term Preservation:
- Maintain code snippets verbatim
- Preserve API names, function names, variable names
- Keep technical acronyms and industry terms
- Maintain URLs, file paths, and system names

Cultural Context Application:
- Japanese: Use appropriate keigo (honorific language)
- Vietnamese: Formal business register
- English: Professional but accessible tone
```

### Data Processing Rules

#### **Privacy and Security**:
- No ticket data stored on external servers
- Local processing where possible
- Secure API key management
- User consent for AI processing

#### **Performance Considerations**:
- Cache frequently accessed summaries
- Batch process multiple translations
- Progressive loading for large tickets
- Fallback for API rate limits

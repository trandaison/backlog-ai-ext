# 🔗 Extension Connection Reliability Fixes

## 📋 Issues Fixed
- ❌ "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist." errors
- ❌ "Unchecked runtime.lastError" warnings
- ❌ Service worker connection reliability issues
- ❌ User info loading failures

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Service Worker Keep-Alive (background.ts)
- ✅ Reduced heartbeat interval to 20 seconds for better reliability
- ✅ Added storage operations during heartbeat to keep worker active
- ✅ Enhanced tab activation handling with heartbeat reset
- ✅ Added Chrome startup and extension install/update listeners
- ✅ Improved message logging for debugging
- ✅ Better ping/pong handling with timestamps
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling in message processing

### 2. Robust Connection Retry Mechanism (content.ts)
- ✅ Added exponential backoff retry system (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- ✅ Ping testing before actual message sending
- ✅ Timeout protection for both ping and messages
- ✅ Intelligent error detection and user-friendly messages
- ✅ Applied retry mechanism to all critical operations:
  - Chat message processing
  - Summary requests
  - User info retrieval

### 3. Improved Error Handling (chatStorageService.ts)
- ✅ Fixed runtime.lastError checking with proper try-catch
- ✅ Added context-aware error detection
- ✅ Prevented "Unchecked runtime.lastError" warnings

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Service Worker Reliability
```typescript
// Enhanced keep-alive with 20-second heartbeat
this.keepAliveInterval = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('🔄 [Background] Heartbeat - service worker alive at', new Date().toISOString());
  // Force a small operation to keep the service worker active
  chrome.storage.local.get('heartbeat').catch(() => {
    console.warn('⚠️ [Background] Storage access failed during heartbeat');
  });
}, 20000);
```

### Connection Retry System
```typescript
// Exponential backoff retry with intelligent error handling
private async retryBackgroundConnection(action: string, data?: any, maxRetries = 3): Promise<any> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      // Test connection first
      await Promise.race([
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'ping' }),
        new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Ping timeout')), 3000))
      ]);

      // Send actual message with timeout
      const response = await Promise.race([
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action, data }),
        new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Message timeout')), 15000))
      ]);

      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      // Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
      const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt - 1) * 1000;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Results
- ✅ Eliminated "Receiving end does not exist" errors
- ✅ Fixed "Unchecked runtime.lastError" warnings
- ✅ Improved service worker stability and longevity
